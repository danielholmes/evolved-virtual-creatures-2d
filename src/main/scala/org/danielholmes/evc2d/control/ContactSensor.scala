/*
Contact sensors activate (1.0) if a contact is made, and negatively
activate (-1.0) if not. Each contact sensor has a sensitive
region within a partâ€™s shape and activates when any contacts occur
in that area. In this work, contact sensors are made available for
each face of each part. No distinction is made between self-contact
and environmental contact
